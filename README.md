# Cinema_Reservation
In this project, I developed a cinema reservation application. This application allows users to choose seats for cinema showings. Here are the key features of the project:
Seat Selection: Users can choose and reserve empty seats through a visual interface.
Movie Selection: Users can pick their desired movie from a selection.
Calculation: It calculates the total price based on the number of seats chosen and the price of the selected movie.
Data Storage: It stores the chosen seats and the selected movie locally, ensuring that the information isn't lost when the page is refreshed.
Visual Design: The seats are color-coded to indicate their status (selected, reserved, or available). Additionally, a user-friendly interface and animations have been incorporated.
This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
